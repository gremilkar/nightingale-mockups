--- Design Proposal: Play controls
--- Proposal Number: 001

This is a suggestion for revamping the play controls.
The play controls as they are implemented in Nightingale 1.8.1 (preview build) look very basic
and don't provide the natural feeling of a button. They are slightly blurry, a bit
pixelated, have no hover state and a very rough appearance for the pressed state
(just the whole thing flipped vertically).

This proposal provides more advanced hover and pressed states and an overall cleaner
look for a much better user experience. Note also the smaller rewind and fast-forward
buttons. This has not yet been implemented in the current preview build.

The buttons in this proposal are also better aligned with other UI elements.
