--- Design Proposal: Faceplate and shuffle-repeat buttons
--- Proposal Number: 003
--- Author: Janek Bevendorff

This is a slightly modified version of the faceplate. The proposal only contains
the paused mode as the playing mode will be the same except the contents of the
faceplate.

The logo on the faceplate is a little bigger now to make it more recognizeable and
it has got a hardly noticeable outer glow.

Additionally, the shuffle and repeat buttons have been altered to give a more pleasing
visual feedback on hover and click events.
